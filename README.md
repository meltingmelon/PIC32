# ECE121: Introduction to Microcontrollers 

## Introduction

This repo contains projects coded for the University of California Santa Cruz's ECE121: Introduction to Microcontrollers course. Projects were compiled and flashed onto the [PIC32 chipKIT Uno32 Board](https://reference.digilentinc.com/chipkit_uno32/refmanual) using the [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide#tabs) and [XC32](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers#tabs) compiler.

All driver files inside the **/include** and **/src** were written by me unless indicated otherwise in comments. For much of our coursework, the Uno32 was required to communicate using UART to a custom written python GUI designed by our professor; the python program is included under the **/labInterface** directory for reference.

For detailed descriptions for each lab presented in **/projects**, please refer to the lab report written. These documents include any information missing from the code base, like state machines and circuit diagrams.
